1. Find the biggest exponential.
	- e.g. For x<sup>3</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> + x + c, you would take x<sup>3</sup> to form O(N<sup>3</sup>)
2. Get the biggest function out when it contains more than 1 function
   - e.g For (x<sup>2</sup> + x + c) vs (x + c), you'd take the first one
3. $F(x) \times H(x)$ is less than $G(x) \times H(x)$  if F(x) is less than G(x)
4.  A function is less than another if its indice is less than the other indice
5. log x is less than x<sup>c</sup> if c is more than 0
6. If you have two functions, x<sup>c</sup> and another where it's d<sup>x</sup>, where d is any number bigger than 1, then d<sup>x</sup> will always be bigger 
7. The one with the higher base and the same exponent will always be bigger
