- Chapter 1-2 and Section 13.1-13.2 of OS textbook

**Main Topics**
- Overview of an OS, development, purposes, components, services
- basic hardware structure and operations
- OS structures

------------
Definitions:
- *Operating System (OS)* : a program that acts as interface between a user and the computer hardware
- [[Kernel]] : a program that is part of an OS and is running at all times on computer
- *Bootstrap* : initial program to run when computer is powered on or rebooted

	- initialises everything, locates, loads and runs OS kernel

Purposes:
- provides environment for user to execute programs conveniently and efficiently
	- users can be people / machines / other computers
- simulates features not available on hardware
	- virtual disks, virtual memory, virtual machines, etc.
- controls all computer resources and provides base at which application programs can be written and run
