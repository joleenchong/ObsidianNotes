- improve performance for large data transfers
	- bypasses CPU to transfer data directly between I/O device and memory -> CPU freed for other work
- CPU gives command to DMA controller with information on pointer of source of data transferred, pointer of destination of transfer, count of number of bytes to transfer
- Handshaking tween DMA controller & device controller uses *DMA-request line* & *DMA-acknowledge line* - handshaking is process for negotiating setting up comm channel tween 2 entities
	- device controller puts signal on DMA-request line when data is available for transfer
	- DMA controller senses signal -> seizes memory bus -> sets intended address on address bus  -> sends signal on DMA-acknowledge line
	- device controller receives DMA-acknowledge signal -> transfers data to memory -> removes DMA-request signal
- after finishing entire transfer DMA controller interrupts CPU:
	- OS sets DMA controller registers to set source and destination addresses, read/write request, transfer length
	- DMA controller transfers blocks of data from buffer storage directly to main memory -> no CPU intervention frees CPU for other tasks
	- DMA controller [[Interrupts ||interrupts]] CPU after transfer completed - one interrupt generated per block
