The kernel consists of everything below system-call interface and above physical hardware (file system, CPU scheduling, memory management, other operating system functions) -> difficult to implement and maintain as everything in one level
- System programs are loaded and start running at boot time
	- called *system processes / daemon* when they run when kernel is running
		- example: init in Linux (runs other daemons)
- once fully booted waits for events to happen -> *interrupt-driven*
	- system knows event happened through interrupts from hardware or software (traps or exceptions)
		- hardware interrupt -> sends signal to CPU by bus
		- software interrupt -> [[System call]] / monitor call

- *Layered System (Slide 59):*
	- OS divided into layers - bottom layer is hardware and highest layer is user interface
	- each layer uses functions and services of only lower-level layers -> modularity -> easy to debug
	- less efficient and hard to define level functionality
- *Microkernel (Slide 60):*
	- smaller-sized kernel -> provides minimal services like process, memory management, communication
	- non-essential services become system / user programs
	- function: a communication facility between a client and OS services using message passing
	- Pros:
		- easier to extend OS
		- more portable
		- more security and reliability
	- Cons:
		- message passing increases system function overhead -> reduced performance
- *Modular kernel* - set of core components that can add additional modules during boot / run time
	- more flexible than layered system -> module can call other module
	- more efficient than microkernel -> no message passing needed
