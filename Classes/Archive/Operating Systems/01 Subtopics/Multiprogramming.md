- Goal : increase CPU utilisation -> keep it as busy as possible
- many jobs kept in main memory at same time and CPU constantly switches between them
	- Job scheduling - OS chooses jobs from job pool and puts into memory
	- Memory management - OS allocates memory for each job
	- CPU scheduling - OS chooses one process (job in memory) that is ready to run
	- I/O allocation
