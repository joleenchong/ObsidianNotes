AKA multitasking system.

Goal : provide interactive use of computer at reasonable cost (one computer - several users / jobs)
- like [[Multiprogramming]] but user input is from on-line terminal and switches based on time period
- CPU switches between jobs frequently so user can interact with their running program
	- on-line communication between users and systems - after finishing one command it seeks next control statement from user's keyboard
	- on-line file system for users to access data and code
