- Goal in [[Multiprogramming]] system: maximise CPU utilisation
- Goal in time-sharing system: switch processes frequently so users can interact with their running programs
- Queues (implemented as [[04 Linked Lists ||linked lists]]) that are stores in OS:
	- *Job Queue* - all processes entering system are put in job queue
	- *Ready Queue* - a set of all processes in main memory, ready and waiting to execute
	- *Device Queue* - a set of processes waiting for an I/O device (each device has its own queue)
	- two diagrams (slide 11 and 12)
- Long-term scheduler function:
	- selects which processes should e brought into ready queue
	- controls degree of multiprogramming (number of processes in memory)
	- invoked very infrequently
- Short-term scheduler function:
	- selects or dispatches a process to be done next and allocated CPU
	- invoked very frequently
- there's another diagram (slide 13)
- [[Processes ||Process]] descriptions:
	- I/O bound process:
		- spends more time doing I/O than computation
		- many short CPU bursts
	- CPU bound process:
		- spends more time doing computations
		- very long CPU bursts
