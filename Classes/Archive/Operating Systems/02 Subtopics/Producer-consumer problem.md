- producer [[Processes|process]] produces information consumed by consumer process
- to run concurrent processes, there is a buffer between the processes filled by the producer and emptied by the consumer
	- Unbounded buffer - places no practical limit on size of buffer
	- Bounded buffer - fixed buffer size assumed
	- Buffers can be in the form of shared memory or provided by OS via message passing
