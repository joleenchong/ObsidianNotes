Definition:
- the process of mapping from one address space to another

| Logical address     | Physical address                   |

| Generated by CPU    | Seen by [[Memory Management Unit]] |
| AKA virtual address |                                    |

Types of binding:
- Compile time
	- can generate absolute code as memory location is known during compile time
		- absolute code - code that loads at a known and fixed memory address
	- if starting location code changes code must be recompiled
	- process must be loaded at same place in memory
	- same logical and physical addresses
- Load time
	- compiler must generate relocatable code
		- relocatable code - execution address can be changed
	- must reload process if starting address changes
	- same logical and physical addresses
- Execution time
	- each process can be moved during execution from 1 memory segment to another
	- needs special hardware support for mapping (e.g. [[Relocation register ||base register]] & limit register)
	- different logical and physical addresses
