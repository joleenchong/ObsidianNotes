Definition:
- storage mechanism used to retrieve processes from secondary storage into main memory in form of pages
- one page of process is stored in one of the frames of memory
- pages of the process are brought into main memory only when required, else they stay in [[Backing store ||secondary storage]]

Characteristics:
- logical address space of process can be non-contiguous
- Frames - fixed size blocks of divided physical memory
	- frame size is power of 2; frame size = page size
- Pages - fixed size blocks of divided logical memory

How does it work?
1. Run program of size n pages
2. OS finds n free frames and load program
3. set up a page table to translate logical to physical addresses

Address generated by CPU divided into:
- Page number (p) -> used as index to page table and contains base address of each page in physical memory (identifies page in logical address space)
- Page offset (d) -> combined with base address to define physical memory address sent to memory unit
- for given logical address space 2$^m$ and page size 2$^d$, p = m - d

Structure of paging:
- logical memory address -> generated by CPU and is page number (p) and page offset (d)
- Page number (p) - index into page table
- [[Page table]] - contains base address of each page in physical memory
- physical memory address -> base address combined with page offset
- page size
