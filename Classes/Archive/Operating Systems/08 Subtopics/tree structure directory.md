A directory containing a set of files / subdirectories. One bit in the directory entry defines the entry as a file (0) or as a subdirectory (1).

Two types of path names:
- absolute -> begins at the root
- relative -> begins from current directory path name 

Advantages:
- efficient searching -> can use both absolute and relative path
- grouping capability -> users can access files of other users
- scalable -> probability of name collision is less

Think of trees from DSA.
