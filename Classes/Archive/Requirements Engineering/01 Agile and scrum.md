Agile is about accomplishing big projects in iterations. With scrum, these iterations are short phases ("sprints"). During the sprint, the project team identifies a small part of the project scope to be completed in the upcoming sprint. After each sprint, the team creates a shippable portion of the project to deliver to the client.

Process:
- Product owner gets input from stakeholders and add scope to the product backlog
- Sprint planning meeting with scrum master and team:
	- after analysing product backlog, select sprint goal
	- decide how to achieve sprint goal (design)
	- create sprint backlog (tasks) from product backlog items (user stories / features)
- team does tasks during sprint - may last 1-4 weeks or one calendar month
- daily 15min stand-up scrum meetings are held during sprints
	- what did you do yesterday?
	- what will you do today?
	- is anything in your way?
	- these are commitments in front of peers
	- everyone is invited to watch - only ppl involved in sprint can talk
- team delivers product to stakeholders for review
	- informal - like a demo of new features / underlying architecture
	- whole team participates - everyone is invited to watch
- team does 15-30min retrospective on what worked and what didn't at end of sprint
	- team can also discuss what they want to start, stop, and continue doing

Roles:
- product owner:
	- defines product features, release date, content
	- responsible for ROI - product profitability
	- prioritises features according to market value
	- adjusts features and priority every iteration
	- accepts or rejects work results
- scrum master:
	- manages project
	- ensures team is functional and productive
	- shields team from external interferences
	- enables cooperation across all roles and functions
- team:
	- around 5-9 ppl
	- cross-functional
	- members should be full-time, with some exceptions
	- self-organising
	- membership only changes between sprints

Product backlog:
- list of all desired work
- prioritised by product owner and reprioritised at start of each sprint
- user stories:
	- IN ORDER TO :value: 
	- AS :user/customer:
	- I WANT :something: (this is the acceptance criteria)
- example on slide 31 (what is value of estimate?)

Sprint backlog:
- individuals sign up for work of own choosing
- estimated work remaining is updated daily
- any team member can add, delete, change sprint backlog
- if work is unclear, define backlog item with larger amt of time and break it down later
