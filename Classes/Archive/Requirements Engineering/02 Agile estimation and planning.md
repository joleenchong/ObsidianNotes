Estimation:
- relative - focuses on size and complexity (story level)
- absolute - focuses on ideal item  (task level)

Sizing units:
- story points - measure of relative size and complexity of story
- ideal days - amount of time something takes a person if not disrupted / distracted

How to size points?
- planning poker - review each story, then everyone shows their card with story points
- affinity sizing - draw a line on wall from smallest to larger, then put stories up on wall relative to each other -> determine points at end
- complexity bucket - determine what buckets (criteria) add complexity, then put story through each bucket to determine story complexity. combine points from buckets then use consensus to decide final story point value

Velocity:
- the measure of team's rate of progress used to estimate future commitments / capacity
- sum the number of story points done in a sprint
- look at slide 12 for burn up chart

Work breakdown structure (WBS):
- the project is broken down into a series of tasks, which are further broken down into smaller sub-tasks
	- helps to estimate time needed for completion
	- tasks can be assigned to different members
- see slide 19 of WBS for example
