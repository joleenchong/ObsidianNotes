Django is an open-source backend framework for Python that uses the Model-View-Controller architecture.
## Projects and Apps
Model-View-Controller:
- Model - controls organisation and storage of data
- View - controls how data is displayed
- Controller - acts as interface btwn model and view

Project structure:
- `__init__.py` - tells Python to treat as package
- `asgi.py` - communicates with server software
- `settings.py` - contains project settings
- `urls.py` - contains route definitions for project
- `wsgi.py` - communicates with server software
- `db.sqlite3` - database
- `manage.py` - manages project with various utility functions

An app in Django will represent 1 relatively isolated component of a bigger web app. Apps must be registered in the project's `settings.py` so that Django is aware of them.

App structure:
- `__init__.py` - tells Python to treat as package
- `admin.py` - connects app with Django Admin and configures app for it
- `apps.py` - contains app config settings
- `models.py` - defines model (classes) used with app
- `tests.py` - defines unit test functions for app
- `urls.py` - contains route definitions for project
- `views.py` - contains app's view functions to process requests and generate responses

```python
# Registering apps:
INSTALLED_APPS = [
				  # ... built-in Django apps,
				  "appname.apps.ExampleConfig"
]
```
- ExampleConfig is the name of the config class found in the app's respective `apps.py`.

## Models and Migration
Models are classes that represent app data and make up the structure of the database.
```python
# Example
class Data(models.Model):
	title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
	author = models.CharField(max_length=255)
	otherData = models.ForeignKey(OtherData, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

class OtherData(models.Model):
	# fields
	# This will be in a one-many rel with Data. OtherData may have many Data but Data can only have one OtherData
```

After adding app to project, generate migrations to use the SQLite database to store instances of your models.

The admin app allows to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) content. To use it, you need to create an admin user and use its username and password to log into the app.
```python
# Admin.py config
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import ExampleModel

@admin.action(description='insert description')
def action_name(modeladmin, request, queryset):
	queryset.update()

class exampleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
	list_display = [field1, field2]
	ordering = [field1]
	action = [action_name]

admin.site.register(ExampleModel, exampleAdmin)
```
## Views and Routes
A view function should take a parameter for request and return a `HttpResponse` object. This is a GET method (in terms of [[REST API]]).
```python
# Views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
	return HttpResponse("Hello World")
```

For POST,  you would need to set the action of a HTML `<form>` to a URL defined in `urls.py`. Each form element will have a name for Django to identify it.
```python
def post_function(request, parameter):
	example = Example.objects.get(parameter = parameter)
	return render(request, 'example.html', example)
```

`urlpatterns` is used to configure structures representing URLs and their associated views. Each element of the list calls `path` that takes 3 params:
- route - URL fragment (a string of characters that refers to a resource that is subordinate to another, primary resource)
- view - reference to associated view function
- name_url - name for path
```python
# App folder urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
			   path('', views.exampleview, name='example')
]
```

```python
# Project folder urls.py - must be updated every time you add a new app
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
			   path('admin', admin.site.urls),
			   path('exampleApp/', include('<appname>.urls')) # app path
]
```

## Templates and Rendering
A template contains static parts of desired HTML output and special syntax to describe how dynamic content will be inserted and processed.
```python
from .models import ExampleModel

def index(request):
	querySet = ExampleModel.objects.all()
	return render(request, 'index.html', {querys : querySet})
```
- render takes 3 arguments:
	- `request` object
	- path to template
	- dictionary to pass data to template

The templates folder is kept in the app container directory. Refer to page 28 of week 3 to see index.html example

Special template notation:
- {% and %} are used for logical operations (e.g. for/while loops, if statements)
- { { } } are used to render data values passed into the template by view function

Templates can be extended -> use same parts of HTML for different pages of website. A base template (`base.html`) provides the core of the layout for extending to every page.
```html
<!-- base.html example -->
{% load static %}
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Title</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="insertBootstrapURL">
	</head>
	<body>
		{% block content %}
		<!-- This section will be replaced with content from another file -->
		{% endblock %}
	</body>
</html>
```
- `block`  is used to override specific parts of template

To extend another page:
```html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block content %} <!-- Defining the block content to be put in -->
<div>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Heading 1</th>
			<th>Heading 2</th>
		</tr>
		{% for model in models %}
		<tr>
			<td>{{model.field1}}</td>
			<td>{{model.field2}}</td>
		</tr>
		{% endfor %}
	</table>
{% endblock %}

```
