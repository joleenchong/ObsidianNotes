A frontend JavaScript library for making UIs from small and isolated components.

Components - like JS classes:
- accept "props" (properties) and return React elements describing what goes on screen
- defined using a JS function / an JS class (function-based vs class-based component)
```js
import React, { Component } from "react";

function Welcome(props) {
	return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

class Welcome extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
	}
}
```
- `props.children` contains child elements defined within component
	- can be used to display other components within existing component
	- included between opening and closing tags when invoking a component

Stateless functional components:
- functions that take in properties and return a [[Document Object Model]] element
- do not have `this` as they're not objects

States:
- an object where a component's property values are stored
- managed within component
- when changed, component re-renders
- optional
- use setState() to change
```js
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Counter extends Component {
	state = {
		count: 0
	};
	styles = {
		fontSize: 15,
		fontWeight: "bold"
	};
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<span className="badge badge-primary"
					style={this.styles}>
					{this.formatCount()}
				</span>
			</div>
		);
	}
	formatCount() {
		return this.state.count === 0 ? "Zero":
			this.state.count;
	}
}
```

Constructors:
- binds event handlers to component and or initialising local state of component
- called before component is mounted
```js
constructor() {
	super();
	this.incrementCart = this.incrementCart.bind(this);
}
```
