An algorithm is a procedure where an inputted value is turned into a different, outputted value in order to solve a problem. Its criteria are:
- always give the correct result
- give the result in a reasonable time
- can be written in spoken language, as a computer program, or as hardware design

How to design an algorithm?
- reduce problem to one with good known solution
- write brute force algorithm and use **tricks** to improve it
- Tricks:
	- use better data structures
	- preprocess the input (e.g. sorting) - data formatted to improve algorithm performance
	- use good algorithm design techniques

Analysis:
- Efficiency measure:
	- speed - how long algo takes to produce results
	- space / memory - how much memory is needed to run algo
- time taken scales with size of input (e.g. num of elements, nodes, links)
- use same [[Computation model|computation model]] for analysed algorithms
- Example (insertion sort) from slide 27-30
