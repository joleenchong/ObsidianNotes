From [[01, 02 Introduction]]:
- split problem into sub parts -> Divide
- solve each part -> Conquer
- re-join parts -> Combine

Usually recursive in nature. Thus, you would need to use recurrence to solve it:
- 

Merge sort example analysis:
- Divide - gets the middle of subarray, always constant time -> 
- Conquer
- Combine
