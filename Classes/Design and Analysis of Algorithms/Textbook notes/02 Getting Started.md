For the sorting problem, the numbers we wish to sort are known as keys.

Loop invariant - at the start of each for loop, the subarray consists of the elements originally in it but in sorted order.

Loop invariants must have 3 properties:
- Initialisation - true prior to first loop
- maintenance - if true before current loop, remains true before next loop
- termination - when loop terminates, gives useful property to show algo is correct
	- most important to show correctness

When first 2 properties are true, the loop invariant is true prior to every loop (similar to mathematical induction, research more).
