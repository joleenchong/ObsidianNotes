NP-complete problems have no efficient algorithms, but have not been proven to not have such algorithms. 
If an efficient algorithm exists for one, then efficient algorithms exist for all of them. 
Several NP-complete problems are similar but not identical to problems with efficient algorithms -> a small change to the problem statement can greatly effect algo efficiency
