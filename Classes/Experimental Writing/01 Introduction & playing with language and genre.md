What makes mr burns experimental?
- no traditional plot structure
- meshing of different structures
- the element of familiarity allows the writer to take it to the extreme of absurdity in terms of how the characters remember the simpsons episodes.

It begins with a "what if", and relies on people understanding the rules of genre.
