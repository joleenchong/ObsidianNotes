User surveys:
- get following from users:
	- social & cultural background
	- psychological traits
	- goals
	- habits
	- other contextual info
- types:
	- user interviews
		- 4-5 interviews - small-scale
		- in person or online
		- 20-30 mins
	- google forms survey - metrics
- analyse data to make quick findings report
- if can't access users - do literature research

Personas:
- evidence based
- fictional info to increase empathy
- personality type, demographics

User journey and user flow:
- insert diagrams

User stories:
- the user's goal
- informal and general to provide context
- "As a {persona}, I {want to}, {so that}"

Competitor analysis - get same market or best in the world

Note: make all of above subtopics

Conceptualising:
- write assumptions and claims when coming up with new design -> try to defend & support what they will provide
	- if difficult to voice, then ideas may be vague or unrealistic
	- identify problematic human activities and interactivites

Conceptual model - provides working strategy & framework of general concepts and interrelations:
- components:
	- metaphors and analogies -> understand what product is for and how to use it for activity
	- concept that ppl are exposed to thru product -> task-domain objects, attributes, operations
	- relationships and mappings btwn concepts
- Steps for formulating conceptual model:
	- what will users be doing when carrying out tasks?
	- how will system support these?
	- what kind of interface metaphor will be appropriate
	- what kinds of interaction modes and styles to use?

Interface metaphors - interface designed to be similar to physical entity but has own properties:
- can be based on activity, object, or combination of both
- examples:
	- what users are doing - surfing the web
	- model instantiated at interface - desktop metaphor
	- visualising an operation - icon of shopping cart into which user places items

Interaction types:
- instructing - issuing commands and selecting options -> quick and efficient interaction
- conversing - interacting with system like having a convo
	- interaction with system is familiar to beginner users
	- misunderstandings when system don't know to parse user's speech
- manipulating - interacting with objects in virtual / physical space 
	- Properties:
		- continuous representation of objects & actions of interest
		- physical actions and button pressing instead of issuing commands
		- rapid reversible actions with immediate feedback on object
	- results of actions are immediately visible -> less user anxiety
	- page 32 of lecture 2b for cons
- exploring - moving through virtual / physical space
- responding - system initiates interaction and user chooses whether to respond
	- can get frustrating if too many notifications or system gets things wrong

Paradigm - inspiration for conceptual model
- general approach adopted by community for carrying out research - shared assumptions, concepts, values, practices
- examples: internet of things, wearable computing, pervasive computing

Visions - invites people to imagine what life will be like in several years
- provides concrete scenarios of how society can use imagined tech
- raises ethical questions like privacy and trust

Theories - explanation of a phenomenon
- can help identify factors relevant to design and evaluation of interactive products
- can predict what users will do with different interfaces

Models - simplification of HCI phenomenon
- designers can predict and evaluate alternative designs
- abstracted from theory coming from contributing discipline

Frameworks - set of interrelated concepts + specific questions for what to look for
- provide advice on how to design user experiences
- focus on how to design particular kinds of interfaces to evoke responses

Don Norman's framework
- The designer's model - designer's model of how system should work
- System image - how system actually works
- User's model - how user understands how system works
