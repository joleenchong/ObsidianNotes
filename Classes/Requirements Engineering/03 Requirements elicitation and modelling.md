Sources of information:
- clients
- users of systems
- domain experts
- pre-existing system (within problem domain)
- other relevant products
- documents
- technical standards and legislation

Challenges:
- knowledge is distributed across many sources -> could lead to conflicting knowledge & knowledge is rarely available in explicit form
- tacit knowledge - ppl don't know how to describe knowledge they regularly use
- limited observability - problem owners too busy coping with current system -> bring in observer to see the problem objectively
- bias - outcome affects people, so they may try to influence you


Techniques:
- traditional
	- introspection - imagines what kind of system is required
	- reading existing documents
	- analysing hard data
	- interviews - can be structured / open-ended
	- surveys / questionnaires
	- meetings - for summarisation and feedback
- collaborative
	- focus groups
		- Joint / Rapid Application development - like workshops
	- prototyping
	- participatory design
- contextual (social)
	- ethnographic techniques
	- discourse analysis
- cognitive
	- protocol analysis - vocalising behaviour
	- knowledge acquisition techniques
there's a bunch of stuff here, i'll revisit in the future
