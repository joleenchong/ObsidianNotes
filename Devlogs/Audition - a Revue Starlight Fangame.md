This will be a game to practice how to use Godot.

The premise is that you pick a girl and fight another girl with it. However, each girl you fight has their own style of gameplay.

Boss fights:
Karen - TCG
Hikari - Spiderman swinging platformer
Mahiru - baseball
Junna - bullet hell
Nana - cooking sim / fruit ninja
Futaba - actually a fighting game
Kaoruko - DDR
Maya - maybe you try to mirror her moves as much as possible? for acting
Claudine - 

The fights will play the instrumentals of some songs in the background.

The loading screen will play atashi saisesan and then fade to an image indicating which girl you're currently playing.

Movie fights will be bonuses and you're limited to one girl.
