# Physical Infrastructure
- Datacentres: 
	- facilities with resources arranged in racks with dedicated power, cooling, & network infrastructure
	- grouped in Azure Regions / Availability Zones
- Regions:
	- a geographical area containing at least one datacentre networked together with low-latency network
	- may limit what services / VM features are available
	- Region Pairs - two regions at least 300 miles away are paired together for replication of resources across geography
	- Sovereign regions - isolated instances from main instance of Azure
- Availability Zones:
	- physically separate datacentres within an Azure region
	- set up to be an isolation boundary - if one zone goes down, the other continues working -> redundancy to protect info from failure
	- a minimum of 3 separate availability zones are present in all availability zone-enabled regions, but not all regions currently support availability zones
	- used for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, & SQL databases
	- Supported services fall into 3 categories:
		- Zonal services - resource is pinned to specific zone (e.g. IP addresses, VMs)
		- Zone-redundant services - platform replicates automatically across zones (e.g. SQL database)
		- Non-regional services - always available and resilient against zone & region-wide outages

# Management Infrastructure
- [[Azure resource]]s - anything created, provisioned, deployed on Azure (e.g. VMs, virtual networks, databases, cognitive services, etc.)
- Resource groups - groups of resources
	- newly created resources must be put into resource group
	- a single resource can be in only 1 group at a time
	- groups can't be nested in other groups
	- applying action (like deletion or access)to resource group applies it to all resources within group
- Subscriptions - a unit of management, billing & scale that provides authorised access to Azure products & services
	- can be used to define boundaries around products, services & resources
	- groups the resource groups
	- Types:
		- Billing boundary - how an account is billed for using Azure
		- Access control boundary - access-management policies at subscription level
- Management groups - containers for grouping subscriptions
	- apply governance conditions to management groups to all subscriptions in management group
	- can be nested
	- Examples of using management groups:
		- create hierarchy that applies a policy
		- provide user access to multiple subscriptions
	- important facts:
		- 10,000 management groups can be supported in single directory
		- a management group tree can support up to 6 levels of depth excluding root / subscription level
		- each management group & subscription can support only one parent
