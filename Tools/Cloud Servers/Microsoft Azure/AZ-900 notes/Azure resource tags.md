Tags are assigned to [[Azure resource]]s to organise and provide metadata about them.
- resource management - locate and act on resources associated with specific workloads, environments, business units, & owners
- cost management & optimisation - group resources together to report on costs, allocate internal cost centres, track budgets, & forecast estimated cost
- operations management - group resources by how critical their availability is -> helps to formulate [[Surface Level Agreements]]
- security - classify data by security level
- governance & regulatory compliance - identify resources that align with governance / regulatory compliance requirements + enforce standards
- workload optimisation & automation - helps visualise all resources participating in complex deployments

How to manage:
- add, modify, delete tags thru Windows PowerShell, Azure CLI, [[Azure Resource Manager]] templates, REST API, Azure Portal
- Azure Policy can enforce tagging rules & conventions
- resources don't inherit tags from subscriptions & resource groups
