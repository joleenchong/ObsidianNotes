This model provides the consumer maximum control over cloud resources, essentially only renting the hardware from a cloud datacenter and being allowed to do whatever with it. See [[Shared responsibility model]] for list of responsibilities.

Scenarios for IaaS:
- lift-and-shift migration - moving app and associated data to IaaS infrastructure with minimal / no changes
- testing & development - rapidly replicate established configs for dev and test environments while maintaining complete control
