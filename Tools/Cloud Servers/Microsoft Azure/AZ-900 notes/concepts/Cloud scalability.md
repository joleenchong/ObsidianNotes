Scalability - the ability to adjust resources to meet demand.

Cloud resources can be added to handle increased temporary demand. As the cloud is a [[Consumption-based model]], you only need to pay for what you use. After demand decreases, resources can be reduced to save cost.

Two varieties of scaling:
- vertical - changing the VM's performance through its components (e.g. adding more CPUs / RAM)
- horizontal - changing the number of VMs to accommodate change in demand
