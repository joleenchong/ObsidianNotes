Two types of expenses for IT infrastructure models:
- Capital expenditure (CapEx) - one-time upfront purchase of  tangible resources
- Operational expenditure (OpEx) - spending money on services / products over time
	- cloud computing falls under this due to operating under consumption-based model

Benefits of consumption-based model:
- no upfront costs
- no need to purchase and manage potentially underutilised and costly infrastructure
- can pay for more resources when needed
- can stop paying for resources that are no longer needed
