Arc extends Azure compliance & monitoring to hybrid & multi-cloud configs using [[Azure Resource Manager]].
- manage entire environment by projecting existing non-Azure resources into ARM
- manage multi-cloud & hybrid virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, databases as if they run in Azure
- use familiar Azure services & management capabilities in different environments
- continue using traditional ITOps while introducing DevOps practices to support new cloud & native patterns
- config custom locations as abstraction layer on top of Azure-Arc enabled Kubernetes clusters & cluster extensions

Can manage the following resource types outside of Azure:
- servers
- Kubernetes clusters
- Azure data services
- SQL server
- virtual machines (preview)
